# LisaGenner-Portfolio-Website

# Objective
The objective was to build a responsive website using HTML and CSS that will showcase your
professional portfolio, which will include the projects you’ll build throughout
your Full-Stack Web Development Program, to your professional network and
potential employers.

# Context

For a professional web developer, it’s become essential that you have a designated place to
present your work and demonstrate relevant skills such as problem-solving or practical
knowledge in a programming language. Since chances are high that you’ll be evaluated, first
and foremost, on the quality of the website itself (not just by the projects you’re presenting),
it’s essential for it to be of high code quality.

In addition, as responsive design has become a basic requirement for nearly all web-based
projects, it’s important that my website be responsive and run smoothly on all devices.

The goal for this project was to create a working website, complete with subpages, that
features key information about you as a web developer, relevant work examples, as well as
your contact details.
